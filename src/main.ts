/**
 * How many reverse proxies sit in front of this process.
 *
 * Everything that counts per caller — the rate limits on the credential
 * endpoints above all — reads `req.ip`, and Express fills that in from the
 * socket unless it is told to trust `X-Forwarded-For`. Behind nginx or a
 * platform router that means every request in the world arrives from the
 * proxy's address and shares one bucket: the API would throttle itself into an
 * outage on the first busy morning.
 *
 * It has to be configuration rather than a constant, because being wrong in the
 * other direction is worse. Trusting a header that no proxy overwrites lets any
 * caller set `X-Forwarded-For` to a fresh value per request and walk past every
 * limit here. So the default is to trust nothing, and a deployment that has a
 * proxy states how many hops to skip.
